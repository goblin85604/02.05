# 02.05

**02.05** is a personal 2D game project — a quiet, melancholic look at a recent chapter of my life.

The game takes place mostly inside a bedroom, maybe a living room, reflecting the weight of unchanging days, unfinished tasks, and an invisible pressure that grows heavier with time. It’s about routine, repetition, and a chance to change that remains unanswered.

This is my first game. I’m not sure how much of my thoughts will make it into the experience, but I hope something resonates.

## 🎮 Gameplay

A small 2D experience. Just one room, one day, and everything that comes with it — again, and again.

No combat. No puzzles. Just life, as it was.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) (v4+)
- GDScript
- Custom pixel art and music (planned, but still undecided)

## ⚠️ Content Note

This project explores feelings of depression, emotional numbness, and the weight of daily life.  
It does **not** include explicit content or graphic imagery, but the tone is intentionally heavy.

## 📅 Status

Early development. Still experimenting with structure, style, and message.

## 💬 Author's Note

This isn’t a story about overcoming. It’s a story about *being stuck* — and still being here.
